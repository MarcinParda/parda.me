## Highlighted
- [Results of 2023 State of JS](https://2023.stateofjs.com/en-US)  - Vite and Vitest growing still growing in popularity. Vue slightly overtakes Angular. And the most commented library is React. (Most likely because of RSC concept)
- [Tao of node](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-node/)  - This article was recommended to me as a guideline for writing clean code in node.js. I'm only halfway through, but I highly recommend it!
- [The Wrong Abstraction](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)  - Essay about why “duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction”. Great explanation why “Don’t repeat yourself” should sometimes give way to code duplication.
- [I tried React Compiler today, and guess what...](https://www.developerway.com/posts/i-tried-react-compiler)  - Article explaining why React Compiler works on presentations but not on every real use case and why debugging it is hard. I agree with final prediction what will happen with all of projects that will use React Compiler in future.
- [Big change to Suspense in React delays release of version 19](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-19-and-suspense-a-drama-in-3-acts)  - I haven't used Suspense enough to form a clear opinion, but I don't like changing how the React API works. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgnw8dRZa3Q) is explaining a topic very well on code level.
