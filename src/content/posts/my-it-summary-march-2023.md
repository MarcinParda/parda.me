# What happened in March 2023?

- I wrote my first blog posts.
- I made my first major pull request for an open-source project.
- I made significant progress in the JSNF course and in understanding how Nest.js works.

# This month, I learned that...

1. Delivering a Chrome extension to production is completely different from delivering a web application. There is no server to deploy. You have to upload the extension to the Chrome store and then wait for it to be approved. This can take a few days, and during the review, no changes can be made to the extension. Therefore, it is very important to thoroughly test the extension before submitting it for review.
2. I have mixed feelings about Nest.js. I believe it provides a clean, modular architecture that simplifies organizing and scaling applications. It also emphasizes testability and supports dependency injection, making it easier to write maintainable code.
   However, in my opinion, Nest.js is too directive and opinionated in many areas, which makes it difficult to adapt to specific problems. Moreover, the learning curve of Nest.js is quite steep. I believe there is too much knowledge required to start working with Nest.js for a non-standard project that is not a simple CRUD.
3. Refinement meetings are my favorite SCRUM meetings. I think these meetings allow for the greatest gains in the speed of delivering features/fixing bugs. I feel that their value is underestimated. If my next project does not include these meetings, I will definitely request their introduction. I believe that these meetings collide different points of view, enhance knowledge flow, and reduce programmers' fear of asking questions.
4. Open sourcing takes time. Firstly, it requires a thorough understanding of the project goals, documentation, and coding conventions. Secondly, changes must be carefully considered to avoid introducing errors or regressions. Thirdly, open-source projects often have strict contribution guidelines, such as code reviews and pull requests. Finally, collaborating with other contributors can lead to debates and decision-making delays, which prolongs the time required to prepare a good pull request.
5. [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) is outdated and it is better to use [dnd-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit).
6. I learned a lot about the integration of backend and frontend from the [JSNF](https://www.jsnafrontach.pl/) course. I also learned about the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and how to use it with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/).
7. I tried these frameworks: [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/). Of these, I liked [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) the most. It is very easy to use and understand for React developers. I really like the concept of using signals instead of Virtual DOM. I hope this framework becomes more popular in the future.
8. I kinda enjoy writing blogs, but it takes up a lot of time. I hope I'll get faster at it because if not, I won't be able to write posts every week.
9. If you enter `behave as senior developer` into ChatGTP, you'll get better responses.
10. Listening to a certain type of music that I mostly associate with work and studying helps me start things that I would normally procrastinate on. My favorite music to start with is [Zelda Lofi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdzrrWA8e7A)
