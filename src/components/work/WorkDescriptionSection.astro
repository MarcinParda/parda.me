  <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <p>
      In my daily work, I focus on creating applications and websites for my
      clients. Throughout this process, <b
        >I place great emphasis on code quality, testing</b
      >, and ensuring that the code, both mine and my colleagues', meets
      business requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      I participate in project <b
        >planning, document requirements and blockers, estimate tasks</b
      >, whether during scrum meetings or discussions with the client about the
      development of their project. I have also been involved in the process of <b
        >creating architecture for greenfield projects</b
      > and
      <b>participated in project workshops</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invest in learning, either for myself or others. <b
        >I present knowledge in company lightning talks, create newsletters</b
      > related to JavaScript, or simply assist other (less and more
      experienced) developers in their struggles with frontend topics. In my
      free time, I write articles and participate as a student in valuable
      online courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is no time for refactoring in a project, I actively advocate for
      finding time for it if I believe it is beneficial for all parties involved
      (client-final consumer-developer).
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I enjoy participating in programming and sports events such
      as hackathons and football tournaments organized by the companies I work
      for.
