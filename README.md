# My personal blog/portfolio

[Personal blog and portfolio](https://parda.me/). The topics I touch on in posts are mainly React and Typescript, but also other technologies related to web development.

Made with Astro.js & tailwindcss.

## Motivation

This blog was created mainly to expand and structure your knowledge on various topics, but if you think the content in it is valuable, I'll be glad if you share it with others.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash

```

or

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/about.astro`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
